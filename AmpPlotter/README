This library contains a GUI for plotting both data and fit-weighted MC for
a single fit.  The user can turn off and on different reactions, coherent sums,
and amplitudes to see how the various fit components contribute to the
projection of a variable.  This directory contains only the library that 
supports the GUI application.  

It should be compiled in the same way that AmpTools is compiled.  Before compiling
set the environment variable AMPTOOLS to point to the directory where AmpTools is
installed

The user needs to write a specialized PlotGenerator
class and also a short executable that invokes the GUI.  Examples of both
of these can be found in the following locations in this repository:

The class to make the user-defined kinematic projections:

The user-specialized application for running the GUI:

Tutorials/Dalitz/DalitzExe/ampPlotter.cc


RELEASE NOTES:

v0.11.0 (19-Jan-2021):

Fix bug that resulted in improper initialization of check boxes for various
reactions in the case a multiple reaction fit is used.

In this version the GUI takes advantage of the ability for the PlotGenerator
class to be created without the generated MC to conserve memory.  If this
use case is detected, the Generated MC button will be grayed out.

If a background file is not specified the background button will be disabled
and grayed out.

v0.6 (28-Jun-13):

No changes to AmpPlotter with this release.

v0.5 (16-Nov-12):

First release that includes AmpPlotter.
